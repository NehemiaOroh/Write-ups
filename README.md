# Write-ups

Hello 👋  

This repository contains my **personal write-ups** for projects, labs, and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges that I’ve completed during my learning journey in **cybersecurity and penetration testing**.

Each write-up documents:
- The approach I used to solve the challenge
- Tools and techniques applied
- Key lessons learned from each exercise

All work shown here was performed in **legal, controlled environments** (such as TryHackMe) and is intended **strictly for educational purposes**.

Feel free to explore, and feedback is always welcome!!!
