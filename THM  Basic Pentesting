Basic Pentesting Write-up | TryHackMe

Hello everyone 👋

This is my first-ever write-up, and my take on the TryHackMe – Basic Pentesting room. This CTF is a beginner-friendly exercise designed to help new learners practice fundamental penetration testing concepts such as service enumeration, brute forcing, and Linux privilege escalation.

I’ll be covering a step-by-step walkthrough of how I approached and solved this room. I’m very open to feedback, criticism, and suggestions — anything that helps me learn and improve is greatly appreciated 🙏# Basic Pentesting Write-up | TryHackMe

## 🛠 Environment Setup

### Connecting to TryHackMe VPN

Before starting the challenge, we need to connect our attacking machine to the TryHackMe network.

I am using **Kali Linux** as my attack machine.

1. Download the OpenVPN configuration file from TryHackMe.
2. Connect using the following command:

```bash
sudo openvpn <your-config-file>.ovpn
```

3. Once connected, verify your connection by checking your assigned VPN IP address.

From here, we can begin enumerating the target machine.
